## Commit Message

When adding the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file along with the XML documentation updates to the `PassengerController` and `UserController`, a comprehensive commit message is essential to clearly communicate the nature of the changes. Below is an example of a well-structured commit message following the Conventional Commits specification.

---

```
docs: Add CONTRIBUTING.md and XML documentation to controllers

- Introduced CONTRIBUTING.md to guide new contributors on how to effectively contribute to the project.
- Implemented comprehensive XML comments for all endpoints in PassengerController and UserController.
- Enhanced Swagger integration with detailed method descriptions for better API documentation.
- Improved code readability and maintainability by adhering to documentation best practices.
```

### Breakdown of the Commit Message

1. **Header (`docs: Add CONTRIBUTING.md and XML documentation to controllers`):**
   - **`docs`**: This prefix indicates that the commit relates to documentation changes.
   - **Summary**: Clearly states the addition of the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file and the XML documentation enhancements in the controllers.

2. **Body:**
   - **Introduced CONTRIBUTING.md**: Specifies the creation of the contributing guide, helping new contributors understand how to participate.
   - **Implemented comprehensive XML comments**: Details the addition of XML comments to the `PassengerController` and `UserController`, enhancing code documentation.
   - **Enhanced Swagger integration**: Notes that Swagger documentation has been improved, which aids in API usability and developer experience.
   - **Improved code readability and maintainability**: Highlights the overall benefit of the changes, emphasizing better code quality.

### Why This Commit Message Works

- **Clarity**: It clearly outlines what was changed (`Add CONTRIBUTING.md and XML documentation to controllers`), making it easy for team members to understand the scope of the commit.
  
- **Categorization**: Using the `docs` prefix helps in categorizing the commit, making it easier to filter and identify documentation-related changes in the project history.
  
- **Detail**: The body provides enough detail to understand the specific changes without being overly verbose, ensuring that the commit message is informative yet concise.
  
- **Relevance**: By mentioning both the contributing guide and the XML documentation, it covers all the key updates made in this commit.

### Additional Tips for Commit Messages

- **Be Descriptive**: Ensure that the commit message accurately reflects the changes made.
  
- **Use the Imperative Mood**: Start the commit message with a verb (e.g., Add, Implement, Enhance) to maintain consistency.
  
- **Keep It Concise**: While detail is important, avoid unnecessary verbosity. Aim for clarity and brevity.
  
- **Follow Conventions**: Adhering to a commit message convention like Conventional Commits improves readability and automation compatibility (e.g., generating changelogs).

By following this structured approach to commit messaging, you ensure that your contributions are well-documented and easily understandable by all project stakeholders.
