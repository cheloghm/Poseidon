## 4. Architecture Overview

The architecture of the Poseidon API Orchestrator is thoughtfully designed to promote a clean separation of concerns, scalability, and maintainability. Below is an overview of the key components and their interactions:

### 4.1 High-Level Components

1. **Controllers**:
   - **Role**: Handle incoming HTTP requests, validate inputs, and delegate processing to appropriate services.
   - **Examples**: `PassengerController`, `UserController`.

2. **Services**:
   - **Role**: Encapsulate the business logic of the application, coordinating between repositories, utilities, and other services.
   - **Examples**: `PassengerService`, `UserService`.

3. **Repositories**:
   - **Role**: Serve as the data access layer, interacting directly with MongoDB to perform CRUD operations.
   - **Examples**: `PassengerRepository`, `UserRepository`.

4. **Models**:
   - **Role**: Define the data structures representing passengers, users, and tokens.
   - **Examples**: `Passenger`, `User`, `Token`.

5. **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)**:
   - **Role**: Facilitate the transfer of data between the client and server, ensuring that only relevant information is exposed.
   - **Examples**: `PassengerDto`, `UserDto`, `LoginDto`.

6. **Utilities**:
   - **Role**: Provide helper functions and services such as JWT generation, password hashing, and configuration management.
   - **Examples**: `JwtUtility`, `PasswordHasher`.

7. **Event Handlers**:
   - **Role**: Implement event-driven patterns to handle actions triggered by specific events like passenger creation or user registration.
   - **Examples**: `PassengerCreatedEventHandler`.

8. **Middlewares**:
   - **Role**: Execute custom processing of HTTP requests and responses, handling tasks like error handling and rate limiting.
   - **Examples**: `ExceptionHandlingMiddleware`, `RateLimitingMiddleware`.

### 4.2 Interaction Flow

1. **Client Request**:
   - A client sends an HTTP request to a specific API endpoint (e.g., `GET /api/Passenger/all`).

2. **Controller Processing**:
   - The request is received by the corresponding controller (e.g., `PassengerController`).
   - The controller validates the request parameters and authentication tokens.

3. **Service Invocation**:
   - Upon successful validation, the controller invokes the appropriate service method (e.g., `PassengerService.GetAllPassengers`).

4. **Repository Interaction**:
   - The service interacts with the repository to perform data operations (e.g., fetching passengers from MongoDB).

5. **Response Formation**:
   - The service processes the data, possibly utilizing utilities for tasks like mapping models to DTOs.
   - The controller receives the processed data and constructs an HTTP response to send back to the client.

6. **Middleware Handling**:
   - Throughout this process, middlewares handle tasks such as logging, error handling, and rate limiting, ensuring that the request and response adhere to application standards.

### 4.3 Architectural Diagram

*Note: It's recommended to include a visual architectural diagram illustrating the flow between controllers, services, repositories, and the database. This enhances understanding and provides a clear visualization of the system's structure.*

- **Token Structure**:
  - **Header**: Specifies the token type (`JWT`) and signing algorithm (`HS256`).
  - **Payload**: Contains claims such as `sub` (subject), `name`, `role`, `iat` (issued at), and `exp` (expiration).
  - **Signature**: Ensures the token's integrity and authenticity.

### 8.2 Authorization

- **Method**: **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
  
- **Roles**:
  - **Admin**:
    - Full access to all API endpoints, including creating, updating, and deleting passengers and users.
  - **User**:
    - Read-only access to passenger data, restricted from performing create, update, or delete operations.
  
- **Implementation**:
  - **Policy-Based Authorization**: Define policies that restrict access to certain endpoints based on user roles.
  - **Middleware Enforcement**: Utilize authentication middleware to validate JWT tokens and enforce authorization policies on incoming requests.

### 8.3 Securing Sensitive Data

- **Password Hashing**:
  - **Algorithm**: **bcrypt**
  - **Purpose**: Securely hash user passwords before storing them in the database, ensuring that plain-text passwords are never stored or exposed.
  
- **Environment Variables**:
  - Store sensitive configuration values such as database credentials and JWT keys in `.env` files.
  - Utilize Kubernetes Secrets or Docker Secrets for managing sensitive data in containerized deployments.

### 8.4 Best Practices

- **Token Expiration**: Set reasonable expiration times for JWT tokens to minimize security risks in case of token compromise.
  
- **Token Revocation**: Implement mechanisms to revoke tokens, such as maintaining a blacklist or using short-lived tokens with refresh capabilities.
  
- **Secure Transmission**: Always use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit, preventing interception and tampering of sensitive information.
  
- **Input Validation**: Rigorously validate all incoming data to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.
