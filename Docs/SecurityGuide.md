## 1. Introduction

Security is a paramount concern for the **Poseidon API Orchestrator**. This guide outlines the strategies and practices implemented to safeguard the API against unauthorized access, DDoS attacks, data breaches, and other potential threats. By adhering to these measures, we ensure the API remains secure, reliable, and trustworthy.

## 2. Authentication and Authorization

### JWT-based Authentication

The Poseidon API employs **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** for authenticating users. Upon successful login, users receive a JWT, which must be included in the `Authorization` header of subsequent requests. This token verifies the user's identity and grants access to protected resources.

**Workflow:**
1. **Login**: User submits credentials to `/api/User/login`.
2. **Token Issuance**: On successful authentication, a JWT is issued containing user information and role.
3. **Token Usage**: The JWT is sent in the `Authorization` header for accessing protected endpoints.

**Example Header:**
```
Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>
```

### Role-based Authorization

Access to API endpoints is controlled based on user roles:
- **Admin**: Full access, including managing users and passengers.
- **User**: Limited access, primarily for viewing passenger data.

Role-based access is enforced using authorization attributes in the code, ensuring users can only perform actions permitted by their roles.

## 3. Rate Limiting to Prevent DDoS Attacks

To mitigate the risk of **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)** attacks, the Poseidon API implements **rate limiting**. This restricts the number of requests a user can make within a specified time frame.

**Implementation:**
- A custom `RateLimitingMiddleware` monitors incoming requests.
- Defines a maximum number of requests per IP address within a set duration.
- Exceeding the limit results in a `429 Too Many Requests` response.

This approach helps maintain API availability and performance under high traffic conditions.

## 4. Sensitive Data Handling

All sensitive information, such as database credentials and JWT secrets, is managed securely through environment variables stored in `.env` files. These files are excluded from version control to prevent accidental exposure.

**Key Practices:**
- **Environment Variables**: Store sensitive data outside the codebase.
- **Secure Storage**: Use tools like Kubernetes Secrets or Docker Secrets for managing sensitive configurations in deployment environments.
- **Access Control**: Restrict access to environment files to authorized personnel only.

## 5. Password Security

User passwords are never stored in plain text. Instead, they are securely hashed using strong cryptographic algorithms before being stored in the database.

**Process:**
1. **Hashing**: Passwords are hashed using algorithms like **bcrypt** during registration.
2. **Verification**: During login, the hashed password is compared with the stored hash to authenticate the user.

This ensures that even if the database is compromised, actual passwords remain protected.

---

## 6. HTTPS Configuration

All communications between clients and the Poseidon API are secured using **HTTPS**. HTTPS encrypts data in transit, preventing eavesdropping and tampering.

**Implementation:**
- **SSL Certificates**: Obtain and configure SSL certificates for the server.
- **Redirect HTTP to HTTPS**: Enforce HTTPS by redirecting all HTTP traffic to HTTPS.
- **Configuration**: Ensure that the server is configured to use HTTPS in both development and production environments.

---

## 7. Security Headers

Security headers add an extra layer of protection against common web vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Clickjacking.

**Implemented Headers:**
- **Content-Security-Policy**: Restricts the sources from which content can be loaded.
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents the API from being embedded in iframes, mitigating Clickjacking attacks.
- **Strict-Transport-Security**: Enforces the use of HTTPS for all communications.

These headers are configured via middleware to ensure consistent application across all responses.

---

## 8. Logging and Monitoring

Comprehensive logging and monitoring are essential for detecting and responding to security incidents.

**Logging:**
- **Serilog**: Utilized for structured and detailed logging of API activities.
- **Sensitive Data Exclusion**: Ensure that logs do not contain sensitive information like passwords or JWT tokens.

**Monitoring:**
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Implement tools to monitor API performance and detect unusual patterns.
- **Alerting**: Set up alerts for suspicious activities or potential security breaches.

Effective logging and monitoring facilitate timely detection and resolution of security issues.

---

## 9. Vulnerability Scanning

Regular vulnerability scanning helps identify and remediate security weaknesses in the Poseidon API.

**Tools Used:**
- **Trivy**: Integrated for scanning Docker images to detect known vulnerabilities.

**Process:**
1. **Configuration**: Define scanning parameters and severity levels in `trivy-config.yaml`.
2. **Automation**: Incorporate Trivy scans into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically scan images during the build process.
3. **Reporting**: Fail builds if high or critical vulnerabilities are detected, ensuring they are addressed before deployment.

This proactive approach helps maintain a secure and resilient API.

## 10. Best Practices and Recommendations

To further enhance the security of the Poseidon API, the following best practices are recommended:

- **Use HTTPS Everywhere**: Ensure all endpoints are accessible only over HTTPS.
- **Enforce Strong Password Policies**: Require complex passwords during user registration and updates.
- **Regularly Rotate Secrets**: Change JWT keys and database credentials periodically to minimize risk.
- **Audit User Activity**: Monitor and review logs to detect and investigate suspicious activities.
- **Keep Dependencies Updated**: Regularly update all third-party libraries and frameworks to patch known vulnerabilities.
- **Implement Penetration Testing**: Conduct periodic security assessments to identify and fix potential weaknesses.
- **Educate Developers**: Train the development team on secure coding practices and emerging security threats.

Adhering to these practices ensures that the Poseidon API remains secure against evolving threats.
