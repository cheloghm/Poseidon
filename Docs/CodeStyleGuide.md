## General Guidelines

1. **Consistency**: Follow existing patterns in the codebase. Refactor legacy code to align with these guidelines when necessary.
2. **Readability**: Write clear and understandable code. Prioritize clarity over brevity.
3. **DRY Principle (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself)**: Avoid code duplication by abstracting shared logic into reusable functions or components.
4. **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each class or function should handle one specific task or responsibility.
5. **Minimize Dependencies**: Utilize dependency injection to reduce tight coupling between components.

---

## Naming Conventions

### Classes & Interfaces

- **Classes**: Use PascalCase.
  - *Example*: `PassengerService`, `JwtUtility`
- **Interfaces**: Prefix with `I` and use PascalCase.
  - *Example*: `IPassengerService`, `IRepository`

### Variables & Parameters

- **Local Variables**: Use camelCase.
  - *Example*: `var passengerService = new PassengerService();`
- **Class Properties**: Use PascalCase.
  - *Example*: `public string Name { get; set; }`
- **Private Fields**: Use camelCase with an underscore prefix.
  - *Example*: `_passengerRepository`, `_mapper`
- **Constants**: Use PascalCase and prefix with `const`.
  - *Example*: `const int MaxRetryAttempts = 3;`

### Methods

- **Method Names**: Use PascalCase and clearly describe their functionality.
  - *Example*: `CreatePassenger()`, `ValidateToken()`

---

## Formatting

### Indentation

- Use **4 spaces** per indentation level.
- Avoid using tabs. Configure your editor to insert spaces when the tab key is pressed.

### Braces

- Always use braces `{}` for control structures (`if`, `for`, `while`, etc.), even for single-line statements.

  **Correct:**
  ```csharp
  if (condition)
  {
      DoSomething();
  }
  ```

  **Incorrect:**
  ```csharp
  if (condition)
      DoSomething();
  ```

### Line Length

- Limit lines to **100 characters**. Break longer lines into multiple lines for better readability.

### Whitespace

- Leave **one blank line** between class members (methods, properties, etc.).
- Do not include trailing whitespaces at the end of lines.
- Separate logical blocks within methods with a **single blank line** to enhance readability.

### File Structure

- Each file should contain **one class or interface**.
- Follow a standard file structure:
  1. Namespace imports (with `System` namespaces first).
  2. Class or interface definition.
  3. Fields, properties, constructor, methods (in that order).

---

## Commenting

### XML Documentation

- Use XML comments for **public methods and properties** to generate comprehensive API documentation.

  **Example:**
  ```csharp
  /// <summary>
  /// Creates a new passenger and saves it to the database.
  /// </summary>
  /// <param name="passengerDTO">The passenger details.</param>
  /// <returns>The newly created passenger.</returns>
  public async Task<Passenger> CreatePassengerAsync(PassengerDTO passengerDTO)
  {
      // Implementation...
  }
  ```

### Inline Comments

- Use inline comments sparingly to explain **why** certain decisions are made, not **what** the code does.

  **Example:**
  ```csharp
  // Use UTC to avoid timezone discrepancies
  var currentTime = DateTime.UtcNow;
  ```

### TODO Comments

- Use `TODO:` comments to indicate areas that require future improvements or refactoring.

  **Example:**
  ```csharp
  // TODO: Optimize this query for better performance
  ```

## Error Handling

1. **Use Exceptions for Exceptional Situations**: Only use exceptions for unexpected or rare conditions, not for regular control flow.
2. **Graceful Degradation**: Handle errors in a way that minimizes disruption to the user experience.
3. **Catch Specific Exceptions**: Avoid catching generic `Exception`. Instead, catch specific exceptions to handle known error conditions appropriately.
4. **Logging**: Log all exceptions with sufficient detail for troubleshooting, avoiding the inclusion of sensitive information.

  **Example:**
  ```csharp
  try
  {
      var result = await _passengerService.CreatePassengerAsync(passengerDTO);
  }
  catch (ArgumentNullException ex)
  {
      _logger.LogError(ex, "Passenger DTO was null.");
      throw new BadRequestException("Passenger details cannot be null.");
  }
  ```

## Architecture & Structure

The Poseidon project follows a **layered architecture** to ensure separation of concerns:

- **Controllers**: Handle HTTP requests and delegate processing to services.
- **Services**: Contain business logic and interact with repositories.
- **Repositories**: Manage data access and communication with MongoDB.
- **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)**: Facilitate data transfer between layers.
- **Models**: Represent data entities stored in MongoDB.
- **Utilities**: Provide helper functions like JWT handling and password hashing.
- **Event Handlers**: Manage events triggered by specific actions.
- **Middlewares**: Implement cross-cutting concerns like error handling and rate limiting.

### Dependency Injection

- Register all services, repositories, and utilities in `Program.cs` using dependency injection.
- Prefer **constructor injection** to promote loose coupling and easier testing.

---

## Unit Testing

Unit tests verify the functionality of individual components in isolation. Follow these guidelines when writing unit tests:

1. **Descriptive Test Method Names**: Clearly indicate the purpose and expected outcome.

   **Example**: `CreatePassenger_ValidData_ReturnsCreatedPassenger()`

2. **Test Structure**: Use the **Arrange-Act-Assert** pattern.
   - **Arrange**: Set up the necessary objects and state.
   - **Act**: Execute the method being tested.
   - **Assert**: Verify the outcome.

3. **Mock Dependencies**: Utilize mocking frameworks like **Moq** to simulate dependencies, ensuring tests remain isolated.

4. **Cover Edge Cases**: Test scenarios with invalid inputs or unexpected conditions to ensure robustness.

---

## Version Control

Maintain a clean and organized Git repository by following these version control practices:

1. **Commit Messages**: Write clear and concise commit messages using the following structure:
   - `Feature/bugfix: Brief description of the change`

   **Example**: `Feature: Implement user registration and login functionality`

2. **Branching Strategy**:
   - `main`: Production-ready code.
   - `dev`: Ongoing development and integration.
   - **Feature Branches**: Create separate branches for each new feature or bug fix.

3. **Pull Requests**:
   - All code changes must be reviewed through pull requests before merging.
   - Include a descriptive title and detailed description of the changes.
   - Reference related issues or feature requests.
   - Ensure all tests pass before merging.

## Conclusion

Adhering to this **Code Style Guide** ensures that the Poseidon API Orchestrator remains clean, consistent, and maintainable. By following these conventions and best practices, contributors can enhance the codebase's readability and reliability, fostering a collaborative and efficient development environment.
